            <h3>Lake Toya</h3>
            <p>Lake Tōya feels like something out of a dream — calm, misty, and surrounded by soft mountains. The water never freezes, so even in winter it looks like a mirror reflecting the sky. I love how it's peaceful but still alive with hot springs and quiet little cafés nearby. It's the kind of place I'd bring a warm matcha latte and just watch the world slow down.</p>

            <h3>Sapporo Factory</h3>
            <p>Sapporo Factory sounds like such a cozy hidden gem — an old red-brick brewery turned into a shopping and café space. I'd love to wander under the glass atrium with a warm drink, especially when the snow falls outside. It has that perfect mix of history and modern charm that feels so peaceful yet alive. Definitely the kind of spot I'd spend hours exploring and people-watching.</p>

          <h3>Vibrant Osaka</h3>
          <p>Osaka has this vibrant, playful energy that I can't wait to dive into — bright lights, busy streets, and endless good food. I'd love to wander through Dotonbori at night, try takoyaki straight from a street stall, and maybe get lost in all the cute shops. The mix of modern city life and cozy local charm feels so fun and real. It's the kind of place where every corner probably smells amazing and makes you want to stay a little longer.</p>

    <!-- ===================== KYOTO SECTION ===================== -->
    <section id="kyoto">
      <h2 class="hover-heading">Kyoto</h2>
      <div class="kyoto-content">
        <p>Kyoto feels like stepping into a peaceful storybook — all soft light, ancient temples, and quiet paths lined with maple trees. I'd love to wear a yukata and stroll through the old streets of Gion, maybe stop for matcha and sweets along the way. The mix of tradition and calm beauty feels so grounding. It's the kind of place I'd visit to slow down, breathe, and just be present.</p>
